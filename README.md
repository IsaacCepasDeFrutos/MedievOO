Vitaminated rock paper scissors pvp game in Java.

This is a project I created during my first year in DAM (Cross-Platform Applications Development). 
At the time, we were learning about OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in Java,
and we were required to build a program to integrate methods and functions,
as well as inheritance between objects. The game was "playable" in Java's terminal.

The idea for this project came because I didn't want to create the typical,
boring OOP-learning program. This idea seemed much more challenging and fun to me.

Overall, as a result of this exercise, I learned a lot about OOP, how objects interact,
and how turns work in RPG games at a low level.

This project wasn't designed to be scalable, so it has been abandoned.
I'm aware of a bug related to the hunter's poison, but I won't be fixing it.

Thank you so much for reading this! :)
